# Gravitational Wave Infographics

This is a javascript module designed to produce infographics for grvitational wave events based on data in JSON format.

This module is very much *in development* and you shouldn't expect either the data used to produce sample graphics to be correct, nor should you consider the package to be feature-complete.
